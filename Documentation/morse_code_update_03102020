April 10th Updates:

Uploaded wiimote_connection_rev1b.py
- This file contains the script where the user inputs the morse code and it will be interpreted
- Once the wiimote is connected...
	- 'Home' button enters into the script
	- Since the counter stats immediately, start typing the morse code, otherwise spaces will be inputted automatically
	- A = dot (0), and B = dash (1)
	- '1' will allow you to restart if you mess up. Once 'reset' is displayed, immediately start entering the morse code
	- '2' will end the sentence and call the interpreter function 
		- This also exits out of the counter loop
		- if the home button is pressed again, the user can type in another sentence
	- If 'minus' and 'plus' are held down together, the wiiremote to shut off and the script will end

Uploaded morse_code_interpreter_script_test.py
- This file was used to hardcode an input and test out the interpreter code. This then got implemented into wiimote_connection_rev1b
